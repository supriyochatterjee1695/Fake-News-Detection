# Fake-News-Detection
This advanced python project of detecting fake news deals with fake and real news. Using sklearn, I built a TfidfVectorizer on our dataset. Then, I initialized a PassiveAggressive Classifier and fit the model. In the end, the accuracy score and the confusion matrix tell us how well our model fares.
